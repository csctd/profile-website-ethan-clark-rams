The HTML file contains the basic structure of the calculator. It includes the `<head>`, `<body>`, and `<div>` tags. The `<head>` tag contains the title of the page and the link to the stylesheet. The `<body>` tag contains the main content of the page, which includes the calculator and the buttons. The `<div>` tag is used to create a container for the calculator and the buttons.

The CSS file contains the styling for the calculator. It defines the width, margin, padding, border, and background color of the calculator. It also defines the styling for the buttons.

The JavaScript file contains the logic for the calculator. It defines the functions for each button and the function to calculate the answer.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. The HTML file creates the basic structure of the calculator.
2. The CSS file defines the styling for the calculator.
3. The JavaScript file defines the functions for each button and the function to calculate the answer.

Here is an example of how to use the calculator:

1. Enter the numbers and operators into the calculator.
2. Click the "=" button to calculate the answer.

The calculator will display the answer in the `#display` element.
